# McG's Pizza Preference List

Each pizza is assigned a grade. A grade consists of a letter that is either
`A`, `B`, `C`, or `D`, and a modifier that is either plus, neutral, or minus.
An `A` pizza is better than a `B` pizza, and a `C+` pizza is better than an
`C-` pizza. Grades are assigned as follows:

If given a choice between pizza `X` and pizza `Y` and you would:

- always choose pizza `X`, then pizza `X` is assigned a higher grade than pizza
`Y`
- sometimes choose pizza `X`, then pizza `X` and pizza `Y` are assigned the
same grade

With the additional caveat that you would tell another pizza lover that they:

- MUST try the pizza if it has an `A` letter grade
- SHOULD try the pizza if it has a `B` letter grade

Pizzas within each grade are also ordered by preference with the pizzas on the
top being more preferred than the pizzas on the bottom. Pizzas on the same
bullet are considered equivalent or to have minimal differences on preference.

Note that this list is based on my *personal preference* and not on actual
*quality*. Your personal preference may differ from the list presented here.
